# Rubiks-Cube

Model of a Rubik's cube in Java through a collection of abstract data types.


# Technologies Used

* Modularization
* Arrays
* HashMap
* Enums
* Access specifiers


# Future Plans

Implement a "solver" module that determines the algorithm that solves the cube in the least number of moves. Such algorithms to consider include:
* Fridrich's method
* Kociemba's algorithm
* Korf's algorithm
* etc.
